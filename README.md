- ⚡ Fun fact about me: I've always been curious by nature. One day, when I was a kid, I was playing on the floor with marbles and run into a semi-death ant. My first thought was to take it and show it to my family. The moment I was entering my house, the ant stung me and I start to cry dramatically, everybody in my house was like, what happens to him? When I finally could talk, I told them about the ant. Everybody immediately changes their concern face to a LOL face.
